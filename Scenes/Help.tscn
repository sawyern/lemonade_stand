text = "Aloha! Help support wahine sports by having a food truck selling musubis! You have a choice to sell for 7, 14, or 21 days. 
You also have control of your inventory, pricing, recipe, and location.

Here are a few tips to be successful:
- Find which recipe (ratio of rice, spam, and nori) to sell the most musubi. Cooked food will spoil at the end of the day 
and will be thrown out. Planning for portions to not lose so much musubi inventory will be key.

- Check the weather report each day. That will factor into customer traffic	 and thus, sales. Bad weather will probably have
 less sales than good weather.

- Customer satisfaction will determine if people will come back more and even in bad weather. Make sure your musubis 
are popular among your customers by perfecting your recipes and prices."
